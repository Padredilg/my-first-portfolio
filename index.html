                <p>
                    My name is Luiz Guilherme Padredi. I am a 24 years old Aerospace Engineering student at University of Central Florida, 
                    and I am also currently learning coding languages with UCF's Coding Bootcamp program. I started my college career 
                    wanting to be a doctor, but while in college I realized that I really enjoyed my math and science classes to the point I 
                    decided that I should pursue an Aerospace Engineering degree. From the moment I started college in 2019 to now, I have acquired 
                    my AA degree, and I am more than halfway through my path to acquiring my Bachelor's Degree. I have also discovered that I 
                    really enjoy coding which is why I have started it now, in hopes that not only will I become more marketable, but also will land
                    a job in which I can apply all of my skills and call it my dream job.
